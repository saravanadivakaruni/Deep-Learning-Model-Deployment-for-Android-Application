Working Methodology:
The overall workflow begins with preparing a deep learning model and converting it for use on mobile devices. A TensorFlow model is first trained or obtained, saved in the appropriate format, then converted into a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model. This TFLite model is deployed to Firebase ML, allowing it to be accessed and used by an Android application for real-time inference.

Importing the TensorFlow Model:
The pre-trained model is saved using TensorFlow's "SavedModel" format. This format includes the complete architecture, trained weights, and computation graph, making it convenient for sharing and deployment across platforms. By using this format, the model can be easily converted and integrated into production environments.

Converting the Model to TensorFlow Lite:
TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) is designed for deploying machine learning models on mobile and edge devices. Converting a TensorFlow model to TFLite provides several key advantages such as Reduced file size, Faster inference times, Optimised execution on devices with limited resources. TFLite enables direct access to inference data without the need for additional parsing or unpacking steps. This efficiency is crucial for mobile devices, which often have constrained memory and processing capabilities. By converting the original model to the TFLite format, we ensure that it is suitable for deployment on both Android and iOS devices.

Using Firebase as a Cloud Deployment Platform:
Firebase, developed by Google, offers a suite of tools for mobile app development. One of its key features is Firebase ML, which allows machine learning models to be hosted in the cloud and downloaded into mobile apps for real-time inference. Once the TFLite model is uploaded to Firebase ML, it can be dynamically downloaded and used by the Android application at runtime.  Allowing for Model version control, On-demand model updates, Lightweight application builds.
Since mobile devices vary greatly in terms of hardware, model performance can differ from one device to another. Firebase helps monitor and address this with the following features --->
Firebase Performance Monitoring:
Used to track inference times across various user devices. This data helps identify performance bottlenecks on low-end devices and offers insights into how inference times vary by device and OS version.
A/B Testing with Remote Config:
To reduce the risk of deploying an underperforming model, Firebase supports A/B testing. You can release the new model to a small segment of users and monitor its impact on key performance metrics before rolling it out to the entire user base.

Integrating Firebase with the Android Application:
To utilise Firebase ML and other features in your Android app, we need to follow these integration steps:

1.Open your Firebase project and select the Android platform.
2.Register your Android app within the Firebase console.
3.Provide the SHA-1 debug certificate.
4.Download the google-services.json configuration file and place it in your app module's root directory.
5.Add the Firebase SDK and required dependencies to your projectâ€™s build.gradle files.
6.Sync the project and build the Gradle files to complete the setup.
